## LowEndPing Network Status

LowEndPing is a simple network query script.

Installation:

- Install Composer
- Download the contents and extract into a directory
- Run "composer install" in that directory
- Run "php artisan migrate" to initialize the database
- Install the python script on the servers you want (see below)
- Edit app/config/lowendping.php and add the servers (Numeric keys are required, and it is recommended to keep them in order), and optionally disable the archive
- Add "cd /path/to/lowendping; php artisan lowendping:archive" to a cron job, every hour or daily would be fine. This is required even without the archive to clean up old queries.
- Edit your webserver configuration and set the document root to (install dir)/public, then add a rewrite rule for laravel (Use google, there's plenty out there)
- Try it out!

Python script installation:

- Install python, python-pip, and mtr-tiny
- Run 'pip install sh' (the required shell wrapper) and 'pip install ipaddress' (required only if python 2.7 instead of python 3)
- Update the information in lepconf.py to point to your server and define an auth token
- Run 'python lep.py' (It is recommended to run it as a user other than root of course)
